# Zenith-Chapter-1-Cropsford
I am currently creating a RPG using the Unity engine

Plot:

The isolated town of Cropsford is on the brink of bankrupcty.Their chance at financial salvation is aligning themselves with the nearby Imperial Kingdom. By joining them, new profitable trade routes will be available, saving the town. Unfortunatly, by joining the kingdom, Cropsford and it's people will be assimilated; they would have to abandon their religion, hertitage, and traditions. 

The town is split by this ultimatum. One side wants to join the imperials, the other, wants to preserve their heritage at the risk of bankruptcy. Lines are being drawnm the sides are becoming more hostile towards each other, and the people not yet committed are becoming  
increasingly pressured to join a faction. Conflict is becoming more of a reality with each passing day.

As a outsider thrown in the middle of the turmoil, you are in a unique position to uncover a conspiracy and to ulitmately affect the outcome of the town. Will you focus on the benefits of joining the imperials? Will you advocate for the preservation of tradition and heritage? Or will you make a third option possible? The choice is ultimately yours....


Game Mechancis Summary:

This is a first person Low Fantasy RPG that emphasizes player choice with a focus on gray morality. The game allows, and rewards you, for playing how you want to play. Is the idea of a chivalrous paladin, protecting the weak and punishing villanry appealing for you? Or perhaps you view playing as the unscrupulous rouge as the wiser option. Or is playing as a mercenary, who is mostly apathetic to politics or greater ideals, seems like the better choice. Ranging from the most virtuous to the most villanous, the game will allow you to play as the character you want to be through diverse dialouge choices, multiple paths in completing a quest, and situations that test your morals.

Exploration is also an important aspect of this game. Throughout your travels, you will come accross various locations to explore, holding unique weapons, armor, items, and artifacts within their confines.
